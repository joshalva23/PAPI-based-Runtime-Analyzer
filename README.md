# Instrumentation of C/C++ Code Using LLVM/Clang and PAPI for Performance Monitoring


Performance optimization is crucial for high-performance 
computing applications. Instrumenting C/C++ code using LLVM/Clang along with 
the Performance Application Programming Interface (PAPI) provides a 
powerful approach to monitor and analyze performance metrics. This 
process involves integrating LLVM/Clang compiler infrastructure 
with PAPI to collect detailed performance data, allowing developers to 
identify bottlenecks, optimize code, and improve overall system efficiency.
